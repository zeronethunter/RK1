THE STORY OF HOW THE UFC CAME TO BE IS ONE OF SPORTS\' MOST UNDERRATED AND FASCINATING STORIES. IN 23 YEARS, THE ORGANIZATION WENT FROM PROVIDING A PAY-PER-VIEW PLATFORM FOR NO- HOLDS-BARRED FIGHTING TO IMPLEMENTING NEW RULES AND FEATURES TO LIFT THE SPORT OF MIXED MARTIAL ARTS FROM OBSCURITY IN THE UNITED STATES. BUSINESS REALLY BEGAN TO PICK UP WHEN ZUFFA, LED BY LORENZO AND FRANK FERTITTA IN ADDITION TO APPOINTED PRESIDENT DANA WHITE PURCHASED THE UFC AND TURNED IT INTO A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR ENTERPRISE. NOW IN THE HANDS OF WME-IMG, THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY--AND SPORT\'S GROWTH IS UNCERTAIN. THE UNORTHODOX ROAD TO PROMINENCE, HOWEVER IS CERTAIN AND IS WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT TO SEE WHAT THEY DID WELL AND WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. HERE ARE 15 FACTS YOU DIDN\'T KNOW ABOUT THE UFC. DANA WHITE\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FERTITTAS. LORENZO AND FRANK FERTITTA MAY HAVE NAMED DANA WHITE THE FIRST AND ONLY UFC PRESIDENT UNDER THE ZUFFA BANNER, BUT THE ORIGINS OF WHITE\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FERTITTAS DATES BACK TO THE 1980S. WHITE AND LORENZO, THE YOUNGER FERTITTA ATTENDED HIGH SCHOOL AT BISHOP GORMAN HIGH, BUT THEIR FRIENDSHIP DID NOT TRULY KICK OFF UNTIL A CHANCE ENCOUNTER AT THE WEDDING OF A MUTUAL FRIEND YEARS LATER. THE TWO SOON DISCOVERED A MUTUAL INTEREST IN COMBAT SPORTS, WHICH LATER PROMPTED WHITE TO CONVINCE THE FERTITTAS TO BUY THE UFC AND NEARLY MONOPOLIZE THE SPORT OF MMA. THE "CHILDHOOD RELATIONSHIP" BETWEEN LORENZO AND DANA IS SLIGHTLY OVERBLOWN, AS THE TWO DID NOT BECOME "CLOSE" UNTIL THEIR CHANCE ENCOUNTER MANY YEARS LATER. HOWEVER, HAD WHITE NOT ATTENDED BISHOP GORMAN FOR THE BRIEF TIME HE DID (HE GOT EXPELLED TWICE), HE MAY HAVE NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH FERTITTA TO BEGIN WITH AND THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE OF MMA AS IT IS KNOWN TODAY COULD BE DIFFERENT. DANA WHITE MANAGED CHUCK LIDDELL AND TITO ORTIZ BEFORE THE UFC. BEFORE TAKING THE REIGNS AS UFC PRESIDENT, DANA WHITE HAD ALREADY STARTED TO BECOME HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH MMA IN SPITE OF HIS BOXING BACKGROUND. HE MANAGED YOUNG UPSTARTS CHUCK LIDDELL AND TITO ORTIZ IN THE PRE-ZUFFA DAYS. IN FACT, WHITE CAN BE SEEN IN THE CORNER DURING SOME OF THE TWO FIGHTERS\' EARLIER FIGHTS. THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS TIDBIT IS LIDDELL AND ORTIZ WOULD GO ON TO BECOME TWO OF THE BIGGEST RIVALS IN THE COMPANY AND DO SOLID PAY-PER-VIEW BUSINESS. EVEN TODAY, UFC 66: LIDDELL VS ORTIZ II RANKS AS THE NINTH HIGHEST GROSSING PAY- PER-VIEW IN UFC HISTORY AND TOPPED ONE MILLION BUYS. IT IS VERY CONCEIVABLE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE DISLIKE BETWEEN THE TWO FIGHTERS STEMMED FROM QEALOUSY OF WHITE\'S AFFECTION FOR THE OTHER, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN WHITE AND ORTIZ. ALL IN GOOD TIME, HOWEVER...
